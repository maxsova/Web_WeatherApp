# About
Weather forecast app is a Year 2 University assignment. Weather app fetches a 5-day forecast for your location by using HTML APIs (geolocation API, openweathermap.org API). The forecast is displayed as a table with temperature, description and a weather icon in three-hour intervals, and a temperature graph with daily temperature trends. The objectives of the assessment are as follows:
1. Write code that interacts with UI controls,
2. Implement HTML5 APIs,
3. Implement exception handling,
4. Validate user input by using HTML5 elements,
5. Validate user input by using JavaScript,
6. Consume data,
7. Serialise, deserialise and transmit data.
The app is created in Visual Studio using the following technologies:
1. JavaScript and JQuery (parse geolocation and API strings, asynchronous (await fetch()) requests, parse JSON response, iterates through weather data appending table cell content and graph data points (using Chart.js library), provides error handling.
2. HTML (markup structure of “DHTML” app, responsive layout, buttons, messages, table structure and headers).
3. CSS (formatting most of HTML elements).
